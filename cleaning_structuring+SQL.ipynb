sewing thread, containing 85% or more by weight of cotton, not put up for retail sale\"\n\nIn order to understand **physical flows**, I also wanted to see **modes of transport** by which commodities arrive in and are sent from Switzerland.","metadata":{},"id":"ac036fca-57bd-46cc-bef1-ffa7b945d5fc","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"SELECT\n\tid AS commodities_code,\n\tTRIM(SPLIT_PART(text,'- ',2)) AS commodities_name\nFROM read_csv_auto('commodities.csv', delim=',', quote='\"', escape='\"')\nWHERE id LIKE '52%'\nLIMIT 11","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"Example_of_HS_code","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"type":"dataframesAndCsvs"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":326,"lastExecutedAt":1768827730903,"lastExecutedByKernel":"122c3dee-4d57-4842-9d21-dc0eda56f3cd","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"SELECT\n\tid AS commodities_code,\n\tTRIM(SPLIT_PART(text,'- ',2)) AS commodities_name\nFROM read_csv_auto('commodities.csv', delim=',', quote='\"', escape='\"')\nWHERE id LIKE '52%'\nLIMIT 11","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":50,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"84a0453c-3dd5-4ec7-a70d-04535cf3fc43","nodeType":"const"}}}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"747315a5-c6a0-4dd6-9e3b-b6a9ba16e9b1","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"commodities_code","type":"string"},{"name":"commodities_name","type":"string"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],"commodities_code":["52","5201","520100","5202","520210","520291","520299","5203","520300","5204","520411"],"commodities_name":["Cotton","Cotton;

First Questions and Ideas about Structuring the Data\n\n## Questions\nFirst questions that popped out of my head while thinking about that dataset were:\n\n**What Swiss Economy consist of?**\n\n**What are the types of most imported and exported goods?**\n\n**With whom does Switzerland trade the most?**\n\n**What transportation channels are the most popular?**\n\n**How has it changed over the last 5 years?**\n\n## Structure\nThe tables come with many columns, which brings a lot of information, but also causes some **errors**.\n\nOne of the problems was **special characters** in the names of the countries and in commodities' explanations or in their units.\n\nTo simplify the process of getting this information, I decided to create **2 dimension tables** (name of `countries` and name of `commodities` with their codes) and **1 fact table** (with the numbers for all the partners throughout 5 years).\n\nIt was possible to download the dimension tables separately, although they needed cleaning.\n\nTo create 1 fact table, I needed to download data for each year separately (as shown on the print-screen above), while it was the biggest chunk of data (ca. 60'000+ rows) which fitted in the limits. After that, all 5 tables could have been combined as they contained the same fields.","metadata":{},"id":"56c046bb-b286-4e93-8310-4b8649055474","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# 3.

**CSV export**, as `nulls` were not correctly read.\n\nA way out was to export the same table to **XLSX** format from the primary source (UN Comtrade), open it in Excel and then export it as
