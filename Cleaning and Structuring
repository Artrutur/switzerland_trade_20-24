I was interested in finding data about **Switzerland's trading partners** over the last 5 available years: **2020-2024**.

Then, I limited the outcomes to the **lowest level of aggregation of commodities (HS-2)**, which means wider and less detailed groups of products, but still detailed enough to draw specific insights.

**HS**, which stands for **Harmonized System**, are codes commonly used throughout the import and export process for the classification of goods (https://www.trade.gov/harmonized-system-hs-codes)

To clarify, this can be explained by an example:

`HS-2` code no. 52: "Cotton"

`HS-4` code no. 5204: "Cotton sewing thread, whether or not put up for retail sale"

`HS-6` code no. 520411: "Cotton; sewing thread, containing 85% or more by weight of cotton, not put up for retail sale"

In order to understand **physical flows**, I also wanted to see **modes of transport** by which commodities arrive in and are sent from Switzerland.
