{"cells":[{"source":"Recently, I studied Switzerland's international trade based on data from the UN Commodities Trade Database (https://comtradeplus.un.org/), which gathers information about countries, trade flows, modes of transport and types of commodities during a certain period of time. At some point, I was curious about the fact that there are not many countries with which Switzerland have a substantial deficit in trade. By substantial, I mean more or equal to 20% of the overall trade per year. The 20% threshold was adopted based on the lower limit of the new customs tariffs introduced in 2025 by the USA.\n\nBesides Germany (with which Swiss have average deficit of 10% and 12.5 bln USD), most of the \"deficit-makers\" do not make more than 4.1 bln USD of deficit per year, which is around 1% of the total imported goods to Switzerland. What is more interesting is that very quickly a substantial deficit becomes almost entirely the value of imports from several countries (where imports constitute 95-100% of bilateral trade). So, a vast part of the so-called deficit-makers only sell something to Switzerland, without buying anything in return.\n\nWhat is it that these countries have and Switzerland does not? What kind of advantage do they have over Switzerland? And is it really their or actually Switzerland's advantage? What brings together countries like Uzbekistan, South Africa, Ghana, Burkina Faso, the Ivory Coast, Peru or Kazakhstan with Switzerland?\n\nTo find the answer, I needed to break down my initial data into more detailed information (from HS2 to HS6 codes of commodities). The more detailed query shows that the commodities from several of these countries totally fall into one category:\n\n7108.12 – Gold in other unwrought forms (non-monetary): Investment and industrial gold in primary forms like bars, ingots, bullion, nuggets, and dore (unrefined gold).\n\nWhich means that it is either gold imported as investment (already as bars or bullion) or as unrefined gold from mines intended for further processing.\n\nTo get a bigger picture:\nSwitzerland constitute ca. 20% of the world's gold trade (according to the commodities trade data from the UN). It is also the biggest Importer and Exporter of gold worldwide, with an average of almost 100 billion USD each year over the last 5 years (2020-2024). Some sources say that even around 70% of each year's refined gold comes from Switzerland, and 3 Swiss refineries out of 7 (there were just 5 until 2025) are Referees of the LBMA's Good Delivery programme, which states world quality standards for gold and silver.\n\nSwitzerland's position in the global chain of gold trade is undeniable. It imports, refines, and exports further. Most of the previously mentioned deficit-makers sell gold in primary forms like bars, bullion or dore, but also as recycled scrap (case of Indonesia).\n\n_________________________________LIMIT LINKEDINA__________\n\nIf we take away countries with small yearly trades, lower than 0.1 billion USD, 53 countries had an average yearly trade imbalance with Switzerland accounting for -64.12 billion USD. Top 13 deficit-makers with a deficit to overall trade of 90-100% have an average gold to import ratio of 97% (with the exception of Nicaragua - 81% - lowering down the mean) and account for -17.98 billion USD. But if one takes all the countries where the gold to import ratio was bigger than 80%, we get 27 states which make -34.84 billion USD of deficit. Worth to add, that this counts only gold from that one category, which is mostly used for investments in form of bars, bullion or powder for refining. Jewellery, recycled scrap and other metals covered with gold are not taken into account in these calculations.\n\nIt is not a lack of Swiss competitiveness that is responsible for the deficit with these countries, but a key role of Switzerland in the chain of gold supply. Simply gold flows in one direction, and it is a good which is either mined in or sold through these countries.\n\n**To check: what part of the whole gold traded by Switzerland are deficit-making countries?**\n\nThis should answer whether Switzerland is also dependent on them in terms of fulfilling global demand or only these countries are dependent from 'gold-centers' where they can sell what they produce.\n\n\n\n1. https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/switzerland-the-world-s-gold-hub/33706126\n\n2. https://www.lbma.org.uk/articles/lbma-announces-new-referees-of-the-good-delivery-programme\n\n3.
